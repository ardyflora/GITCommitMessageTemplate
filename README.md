# GIT Commit Message Template
> GIT commit message template to help write a better commit message

# Subject line with tracking info if any
Creating commit message template - #123

# Description
More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Since, there are various variations on how to write a commit message. Most developers agree that picking one and sticking to it is far better than the chaos that ensues when everybody does their own thing. 

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. You should really focus on "Why".

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
 - Bullet points are okay, too
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

# Testing Information
Here, you may show what were the test results if any which only ensures that you tested your code, but also gives other people confidence and saves them time to think about few other things.

# Issue Tracking Info
If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom, like this:
